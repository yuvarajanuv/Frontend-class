      However, everyone is not fortunate enough to experience that life as many people do not have a good financial background to afford the expensive college fees and hence miss the opportunity of enjoying their life. College life is not only about enjoyment with friends but many students end up meeting the love of their life in the college. These love stories are a part of every college student leaving some exceptional cases though. On the other hand, college life exposes us to new challenges every day as we have to socialize with people who are unknown to us. <b>

      </b>Also, students get more confident and independent once they are college students.
